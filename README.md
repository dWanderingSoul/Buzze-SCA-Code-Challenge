## Introduction

Buzze aims to provide a platform for users to connect, share their thoughts, and engage with others through posts. This repository focuses on the backend API that powers the application, handling data management, user authentication (planned), and post creation/retrieval.  We believe in building a robust and scalable platform that fosters meaningful interactions.  This is a work in progress, and we encourage community involvement to help shape its future.

## Features

- **Post Creation:** Users can create new posts with text content. (Image uploads and other media types are planned for future iterations).  Posts can be associated with specific users and timestamps.
- **Post Retrieval:** API endpoints to retrieve posts:
    - Retrieve all posts (with pagination for efficient handling of large datasets).
    - Retrieve posts by a specific user.
    - Retrieve a single post by its unique ID.
    - Implement search functionality to find posts based on keywords (future enhancement).
- **User Authentication (Planned):** Future implementation will include:
    - User registration and login.
    - Secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to protect user data.
    - Password hashing for secure storage.
    - User profiles with basic information (username, bio, etc.).
- **Data Validation:** Input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.  This will include checks for required fields, data types, and length restrictions.
- **RESTful API Design:** Clear and consistent API endpoints following REST principles, using appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with scalability in mind to handle a growing user base. Future enhancements will include database optimizations, caching strategies (e.g., Redis), and load balancing.
- **Testing:**  Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The runtime environment for the backend server, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- **Express.js:** A web framework for building the API, simplifying routing, middleware management, and request handling.
- **MongoDB (or other database - to be specified):** Database for storing user data and posts. (Consider Mongoose or other ODM for easier interaction with the database).  The choice of database can be configured.
- **(Other dependencies - to be added as needed):**
    - `body-parser`: For parsing request bodies JSON.
    - `jsonwebtoken`: For implementing JWT-based authentication.
    - `bcrypt` or `argon2`: For password hashing.
    - `multer`: For handling file uploads (when media support is added).
    - `jest` or `mocha` with `supertest`: For testing.
    - `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
    - `nodemon`: For automatic server restarts during development.
